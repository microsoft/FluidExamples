# Welcome to the Fluid Framework Examples Repository!

This codebase includes examples of collaborative applications built with the Fluid Framework. For documentation about the Fluid Framework, go to [FluidFramework.com](https://fluidframework.com/). The Fluid Framework repository lives at [Github.com/Microsoft/FluidFramework](https://github.com/microsoft/fluidframework).

Each example is a standalone application that defines a Fluid Container and loads it into a webpage.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and navigate to one of the example folders. From the example root, you can install and start the example.

1. Run `npm install` from the example root
2. Run `npm run start` to start both the client and server

> For more details see the individual example README.md.
