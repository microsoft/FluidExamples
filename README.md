# Welcome to the Fluid Framework Examples Repository!

This codebase includes examples of collaborative applications built with the Fluid Framework.
For documentation about the Fluid Framework, go to [FluidFramework.com](https://fluidframework.com/).
The Fluid Framework repository lives at [Github.com/Microsoft/FluidFramework](https://github.com/microsoft/fluidframework).

Each example in this repository is a standalone application that defines a Fluid Container and loads it into a webpage.
