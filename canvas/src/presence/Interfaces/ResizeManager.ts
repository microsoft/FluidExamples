 * ResizeManager Interface
 *
 * Manages resize operations for shapes and elements in the Fluid Framework demo app.

 * resizing an element.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Real-time resize state synchronization
 * - Position and size tracking during resize operations
 * - Visual feedback for ongoing resize operations
 * - Multi-client resize conflict prevention
 * - Clean up of resize states when operations complete
