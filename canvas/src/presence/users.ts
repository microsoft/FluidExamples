/**
 * Users Manager Implementation
 *
 * This module provides the concrete implementation of the UsersManager interface
 * for managing user presence and information in the Fluid Framework demo app.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Real-time user presence tracking across all clients
 * - User profile management (name, avatar, etc.)
 * - Connection state monitoring (connected/disconnected users)
 * - Current user (myself) information management
 * - User list synchronization and event-driven updates
 * - Comprehensive user filtering by connection status
 *
 * The users manager uses Fluid Framework's presence system to maintain
 * an up-to-date list of all users in the collaboration session, including
 * their profile information and connection status.
