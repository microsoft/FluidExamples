Brainstorm is an example of using the Fluid Framework to build a collaborative line of business application. In this example each user can create their own sticky notes that is managed on a board.

This application was shown during a [Microsoft Build session](https://aka.ms/OD522).

## Getting Started

To run this follow the steps below:

1. Run `npm install` from the brainstorm folder root
2. Run `npm run start` to start the client
3. Run `npx tinylicious` to start the "Tinylicious" test service
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in a browser tab

This package is based on the [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html), so much of the Create React App documentation applies.

## Using the Brainstorm App

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

You'll be taken to a url similar to 'http://localhost:3000/**#1621961220840**' the path `##1621961220840` is specifies one brainstorm document.

2. Create another chrome tab with `http://localhost:3000/**#1621961220840**`

Now you can create notes, write text, change colors and more!
