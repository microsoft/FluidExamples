# Shared Tree Demo

This app demonstrates how to create a simple tree data structure and build a React app using that data.

## Setting up the Fluid Framework

This app is designed to use
[Azure Fluid Relay](https://aka.ms/azurefluidrelay) a Fluid relay service offered by Microsoft. You can also run a local service for development purposes. Instructions on how to set up a Fluid relay are on the [Fluid Framework website](aka.ms/fluid).

To use AzureClient's local mode, you first need to start a local server.

```bash
npm run start:server
```

Running this command from your terminal window will launch the Azure Fluid Relay local server. Once the server is started, you can run your application against the local service.

```bash
npm run start
```

One important note is that you will need to use a token provider or, purely for testing and development, use the insecure token provider. There are instructions on how to set this up on the [Fluid Framework website](aka.ms/fluid).

All the code required to set up the Fluid Framework and SharedTree data structure is in the infra folder. Most of this code will be the same for any app.

## Schema Definition

The SharedTree schema is defined in the schema.ts source file. This schema is passed into the SharedTree when it is initialized in index.tsx. For more details, see the schema.ts comments.

## Working with Data

Working with data in the SharedTree is very simple; however, working with distributed data is always a little more complicated than working with local data. One important note about managing local state and events: ideally, in any app you write, it is best to not special case local changes. Treat the SharedTree as your local data and rely on tree events to update your view. This makes the code reliable and easy to maintain. Also, never mutate tree nodes within events listeners.

## User Interface

This app is built using React. If you want to change the css you must run 'npx tailwindcss -i ./src/index.css -o ./src/output.css --watch' in the root folder of your project so that tailwind can update the output.css file.

## Building and Running

You can use the following npm scripts (`npm run SCRIPT-NAME`) to build and run the app.
