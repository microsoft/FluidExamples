## About this repo

This is an example to demonstrate a basic use of the TaskManager DDS in React. Here we use React.js for the view, but you can use any framework you'd like.

## Using this repo

### Run the app locally

To run our local server, Tinylicious, on the default URL of `localhost:7070`, enter the following into a terminal window:

```
npx tinylicious
```

Now, with our local service running in the background, we need to connect the application to it. The app has already been configured to this so now we just need to run the following in a new terminal window to start the app.

```bash
npm i
npm start
```
