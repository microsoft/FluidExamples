## Using this repo

### Run the app locally

To run this application you must have Node and Angular installed on your local machine. Please ensure these are installed prior to running the application locally.

To run our local server, Tinylicious, on the default values of `localhost:7070`, enter the following into a terminal window:

```
npx tinylicious
```

Now, with our local service running in the background, we need to connect the application to it. The app has already been configured to this so now we just need to run the following in a new terminal window to start the app.

```
npm install
npm start:client
```
